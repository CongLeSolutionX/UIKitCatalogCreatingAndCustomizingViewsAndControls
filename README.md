# UIKitCatalogCreatingAndCustomizingViewsAndControls
This is a sample code from Apple with my modifications.

---

My touches: 
- Remove all prototypes built by the Interface Builder and programmatically rewrite those UI prototypes.. => Increasing reusable for all the UI elements across team and multiple application.
